## Design Decisions

* **React + Vite:** Used Vite for faster development and hot reloading; React for component-based UI.
* **Redux Toolkit:** Manages global state of tasks and timer with simple, scalable reducers.
* **Material UI:** Provides a clean, accessible, and responsive design system with built-in theming.
* **Recharts:** Visualizes task time data with an interactive bar chart for productivity stats.
* **Responsive Design:** Achieved with Material UI‚Äôs responsive props and components for usability on multiple screen sizes.
* **Dark Mode:** Implemented with Material UI theme toggling for better user experience in different lighting conditions.
* **Frontend-only:** No backend or authentication to keep scope aligned with assignment requirements.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

* No data persistence; task and timer data resets on page reload. Could add localStorage or backend integration.
* Timer state only works per browser tab; no sync across tabs or devices.
* Tasks cannot be edited once added; adding edit functionality would improve usability.
* Accessibility can be enhanced with better ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.
* Productivity stats could be expanded with filtering, exporting, or additional chart types.
* More robust input validation and error handling.
* Add automated tests for components and redux logic.
